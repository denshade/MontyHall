# MontyHall

This is a simple simulation of the MontyHall problem. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem

It simulates the presenter and the host. 

I ran this simulation 1 000 000 times and check how often the result is correct. 

I was unconvinced until I found the following result: 

Winrate after receiving the presenter tip and changing:0.666342
Winrate without a tip 0.333468

Don't believe it? Feel free to try it yourself.
